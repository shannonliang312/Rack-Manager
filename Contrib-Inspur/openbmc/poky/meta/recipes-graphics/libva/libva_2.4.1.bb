SUMMARY = "Video Acceleration (VA) API for Linux"
DESCRIPTION = "Video Acceleration API (VA API) is a library (libVA) \
and API specification which enables and provides access to graphics \
hardware (GPU) acceleration for video processing on Linux and UNIX \
based operating systems. Accelerated processing includes video \
decoding, video encoding, subpicture blending and rendering. The \
specification was originally designed by Intel for its GMA (Graphics \
Media Accelerator) series of GPU hardware, the API is however not \
limited to GPUs or Intel specific hardware, as other hardware and \
manufacturers can also freely use this API for hardware accelerated \
video decoding."
